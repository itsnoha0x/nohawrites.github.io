  "articleBody": "Cybersecurity has evolved from a mystery we hear about in the news to almost a necessity and a trend, affecting all fields and garnering global attention.\nAs there is no smoke without fire, the escalation of cybersecurity is driven by the rise of technology, emerging cyber threats, and the challenges that follow each innovation. To respond to this new demand and make it simple for students or individuals interested, I spoke with Emre, a cybersecurity student who’s already gained valuable real-world experience. He helped us provide a roadmap and a list of advice that we have listed below.\nHow did he get into cybersecurity? Emre is currently a student and apprentice engineer in cybersecurity. He earned a University Diploma of Technology specializing in cybersecurity. He completed this through an apprenticeship as a Pentester and Blue Teamer, which allowed him to gain extensive technical experience in cybersecurity!\nIn parallel, he created a cybersecurity association called CyberV. An international association with several hundred members to bring together students, professionals, and anyone interested in the field.\nHis first encounter with cybersecurity happened at the age of 13, when his passion for development led him to run a piece of malicious code he found online, and he compromised all of his accounts immediately.\nWhat felt like a disaster at the time turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Through that experience, he discovered the cybersecurity world and began his journey by learning from YouTube and hands-on programs.\nWhile this story sounds adventurous, cybersecurity is flexible, and anyone can find their way differently. The cybersecurity landscape is filled with professionals of all ages, proving that passion and dedication are the true drivers of success. No matter who you are, what age, or if your accounts have been hacked or not…\nThe skills you need to start in cybersecurity: Cybersecurity is far more than just lines of code and firewalls. It’s not only about technology, but it expands to all fields like geopolitics, international law, and day-to-day interactions.\nBut if you are into the ‘technical’ aspect, Emre thinks there are plenty of must-have foundations to master before diving into big concepts like pentesting, forensics, or OSINT. So here is the list:\nNetworking Understanding how machines communicate is fundamental. This means diving deep into networking concepts like the OSI and TCP/IP models, learning key protocols, and knowing how to set up and configure a network.\nCybersecurity is all about protecting systems and data across networks, so understanding how it works would be the first step before exploring attacks or securing methods.\nOperating Systems Since they are the foundation for all software, you should get comfortable with them. Know how they work and what their vulnerabilities are. We’re talking about Linux commands, Windows, and PowerShell, process management, permissions, logs, and all the other skills that come with it.\nDevelopment / Programming: Scripting and understanding code are valuable skills in the field! Maybe not to a high level of a developer, but moderate to use it comfortably.\nPython for scripting and automation, Bash for tasks in Linux, and C for those interested in low-level security and reverse engineering. Remember to start small with the basics and practice regularly with projects.\nWeb The web is a major attack vector, so understanding how websites work and their common vulnerabilities is a huge advantage. This includes learning about web application architectures and common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection (SQLi), cross-site scripting (XSS), server-side request forgery (SSRF), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).\nIn little words, you can’t defend what you don’t understand. A strong foundation in all aspects of technology helps you build your cybersecurity knowledge with less further struggle.\nOnce you have these solid basics, you’ll find it much easier to specialize in what excites you most in the cybersecurity branches (pentesting, SOC, incident response, reverse engineering…)\nIs that all you need? (Breakdown of Soft Skills) Like any other career, soft skills are as important! Because cybersecurity isn’t only about machines, it’s about people!\nTechnical skills are a must, but they become almost useless if you can’t communicate them to your teammates and clients. You should master the art of presentations, writing effective reports, working on a team, and even leading projects. The stronger your personality is amongst your peers, the more likely you are to reach success.\nSince technology evolves so fast, having a sense of curiosity and a continuous ability to learn and explore is crucial. Cyberthreats increase immensely, and companies are competing to create new technologies. With that being said, you too should be as fast and as motivated to learn and keep your skills updated.\nAnd those are things to learn and practice. Don’t assume they’ll just come naturally. Invest your time in developing your communication, collaboration, and critical thinking abilities.\nMisconceptions about cybersecurity I asked Emre about the misconceptions he sees in the field that must be clarified. From imagining a hooded guy in a dark room coding and hacking twenty-four-seven to the false impressions about cybersecurity roles and the job market.\nSo let’s see what misconceptions there are:\n“Cybersecurity is just hacking/pentesting and technical work.”\nFalse. Cybersecurity is not limited to penetration testing and coding. It includes a variety of roles that often do not require deep technical expertise. It also encompasses law, risk management, governance, policy-making, and security awareness. In fact, cybersecurity is a multidisciplinary domain where you can find your place even if hacking and coding aren’t your main interests.\n“You need to get a lot of certifications to become an expert and build a career.”\nCertifications can be valuable, but they do not replace practical skills and experience. A well-known certification may help, but it doesn’t automatically make you a cybersecurity expert. What truly matters is what you bring to the table. Your ability to understand and analyze threats, gather information, and solve security problems in real-life scenarios.\nThink of certifications as a plus, a proof of investing time into learning and improving, but not guaranteeing success. They become useless if you’re not willing to continue the work and practice.\n“You need to be a coding genius to work in cybersecurity.”\nNot at all. While basic scripting skills in Python, Bash, or PowerShell can be useful, they are not essential to get started. Cybersecurity is a broad field with many roles that focus more on network security, system administration, threat analysis, and risk management rather than coding. It is far more important to understand networks, systems, and web security.\nCoding skills can be an advantage, but they are not a strict requirement for building your career.\n“Recruiters will chase after you.”\nNot quite the case. Cybersecurity is in high demand, but that doesn’t mean you will automatically get hired because of your degree or a few certifications. While opportunities are growing, so is the competition, and those who do the bare minimum won’t stand out.\nContinuous learning, curiosity, and real projects are key to attracting recruiters. Building a strong professional presence and all the mentioned skills will set you apart. But it’s wrong to expect recruiters to chase after you if you’re not exceptional!\nIn short: Cybersecurity is an exciting world, offering a wealth of opportunities for those who are prepared to dive in. Hopefully, this article has given you the first keys to start and made the vision a bit clearer.\nAs you begin your journey, keep in mind that:\nCybersecurity welcomes everyone: it is a flexible domain you can join regardless of your background. A strong foundation is key: Cybersecurity needs a solid understanding of different aspects of technology since you can’t secure what you do not know. Practice makes perfect: The field requires a lot of practice, and hands-on experience way more than theory. Think of projects, CTF competitions, virtual practice labs, and more. Continuous learning: Stay curious and never stop learning to keep up with its fast rhythm. A huge thank you to Emre for sharing his journey with us. Now it’s your turn; take that first step, whether it’s setting up your first lab, joining a CTF competition, or simply exploring more on the blog.\n",
