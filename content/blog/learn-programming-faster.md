If you dream of launching an app, landing an internship, or finally feeling confident with your skills, here’s how to learn programming faster without the overwhelm.

Most programming learners struggle to make progress. They’re not sure whether they’re improving, and feel like they almost know something, but never enough. Programming feels easy, hard, fun, and complicated all at once.

To solve this endless loop, I reached out to a DevOps Automation Expert with a Master's in Cybersecurity and over 7 years of experience in the field.

Let’s dive into the secrets of mastering programming with our guest Mr [Aziz Vanka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/azizvanka/)…

## From childhood to the world of DevOps

> “I first discovered programming at the age of 8 with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I realized early on that you could create things by writing code, just like writing a book.”

He was one of the early age discoverers who pursued curiosity to learn about programming. Programming starts to make sense the moment you realize its power. The ability to write code that does what you want, or what you tell it. So you begin to make connections on how to befriend the computer, how to speak to it using its logic and language.

These practices naturally build your problem-solving skills and critical thinking, which are the core of a coder’s mindset.

He then traced his way to DevOps later in life, only to find that it improves his development skills and speeds up the process. As we know, DevOps is the heaven of automating tests, managing versioning and code updates, and automating deployment to finalize a software. All these rely on coding differently, making a new practice environment for the coding skills to grow.

## How to Learn Programming Effectively

### To learn programming faster, it is crucial to distinguish between understanding and memorization.

The process of learning a language should begin by reading and familiarizing oneself with the syntax. We may have to memorize the basics of how to declare or create certain patterns, but it becomes useless to rely on memory. What remains is the precise understanding of each concept, the why and how we do things behind the hood, and the logic that will help you solve bugs and problems.

Understanding what you do is the long-term strategy to flexibility and expertise. Instead of memorizing, wonder: why a loop works, why an error happens, why this code is better than the other…

### Practice is the key. The classic advice that never fails to work!

Like any other technical skill, programming heavily requires continuous practice. The more you practice, the more mistakes you make, and the more you learn from them. Each error is a new learning experience, and debugging will become your best friend to help you understand the language and its mechanisms.

### Balancing Theory and Practice.

Both theory and practice are crucial in learning. The most effective way to bridge the two is through debugging. Start by learning the theory, put it into action, then troubleshoot those errors. Real debugging involves diving into documentation, understanding the error, and using breakpoints to evolve, rather than copying and pasting solutions found online.

## Common Mistakes of Beginners

A major reason for slowing progress is a lack of motivation. This is normal, and it may happen due to overwhelm, lack of vision, or the result you see vs the high expectations you dream of. We all know that coding doesn’t happen in days; it takes time, a lot of time, and projects and practice. 

Additionally, copying and pasting code without understanding is a big mistake. With all those AI models that compete to make you the best-working code, you lose if you don’t understand it yourself. While copying code can be useful in certain situations, it is important to grasp what you are doing to learn. However, if the code fails, it forces beginners into a debugging loop, which is where real learning happens.

Also, do not stick to one language and accept the struggle. Sometimes a language might not suit your needs or learning style, and it's important to experiment with different languages until you find one that works for you. 

And remember that software developers have their focus, so there is no need to try to master everything at once. You can look into the very specific fields you want to be in, and start from there. 

## Tools and Best Practices

Today, many tools make learning programming easier. Mr Aziz thinks that documentation, videos, and quizzes (to track the progress) are essential. It's also important to assess your skills at various levels, to keep up with the fast pace of technological change in IT. Forums and friends are also key resources to push you on.

> “I would first read the documentation, then debug. If I couldn't find a solution after a few days, I would turn to forums. Friends played a vital role by suggesting projects and ideas, helping me stay motivated and on track.”

Personally, as a [cybersecurity](https://nohawrites.com/blog/how-to-break-into-cybersecurity/) student who’s into coding, I recommend [freecodecamp.com](https://freecodecamp.com) as a great platform! With all its projects and gamified style, it will add real value to your coding journey.

## If I Had to Start Learning Programming from Scratch

> “If I had to start from scratch, I would begin with HTML, CSS, then JavaScript, followed by Python and Assembly.”
> 

And honestly, that makes a lot of sense! Starting with web development is a smooth entry point, since HTML is straightforward for structuring. And both CSS and JavaScript are its teammates, one makes things look good, the other brings it to life with functionalities.

Web languages, followed by Python and C, then Assembly, for depth, is an ideal path. It will make you strong in no time!

## Simply said,

Learning to program isn't about speed; it's about momentum.

Programming can be confusing at times, but all you need is a deep breath and a new project! Even if you feel like your skills are freezing, your brain is still processing new things, and it takes time to show.

So to recap, 

- Focus on understanding the code rather than memorizing or copy-pasting
- Practice as much as you can and build little projects in the way
- Balance theory and practice, befriend debugging all the time
- Change the language or the learning style until you find what works for you
